# ML_based_student_attendance
This Project focuses on eliminating traditional attendance based system present in educational institutions. We implemented this project using ML algorithms, dlib libraries (openCV) ,MySQL which handles student's attendance data and marks attendance on hourly basis. We were able to avoid proxies and fixed time frame to avoid multiple logins
