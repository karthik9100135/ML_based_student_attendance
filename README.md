# ML_based_student_attendance
This Project focuses on eliminating traditional attendance based system present in educational institutions. We implemented this project using ML algorithms, dlib libraries (openCV) ,MySQL which handles student's attendance data and marks attendance on hourly basis. We were able to avoid proxies and fixed time frame to avoid multiple logins


ABSTRACT

Managing student attendance manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with large datasets. Smart and automated attendance systems address these challenges by using live video streams and advanced technologies like OpenCV and machine learning for real-time face detection and recognition. By comparing detected faces with a pre-stored dataset, these systems ensure accurate and transparent attendance marking while eliminating issues like proxies and duplications.

These systems save time, enhance scalability, and maintain data security by integrating with databases like MySQL. Additionally, they support session-based tracking and exporting attendance records. Such innovations make attendance management efficient, reliable, and fair, reducing the burden on educators while accommodating large student populations.
